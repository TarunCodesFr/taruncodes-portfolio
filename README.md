# App made with ReactJS & Vite

This app is made by TarunCodes to showcase their work, experience and projects using ReactJs & Vite website framework. The motive to make the source code public is so the people and developers can see the code and use the components for their own projects, NOTE: You can use the code of this repository but you would need to give the credit to me (TarunCodes)!
